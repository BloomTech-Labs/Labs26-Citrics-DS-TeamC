# Labs Citrics DS template

## Task:
Finding a place to live is hard! Nomads struggle with finding the right city for them. Citrics is a city comparison tool that allows users to compare cities and find cities based on user preferences. Data science students will be focused on scraping + cleaning city data along with predicting what the future of cities would look like. Web students will focus on complex state management of user + city data and focus on city visualizations.
